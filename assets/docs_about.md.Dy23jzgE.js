DDoS attacks can render services unavailable, cause network congestion, and increase latency, placing immense pressure on applications and systems.</p><p>Developers often spend significant time and resources mitigating attacks and protecting their servers and infrastructure, which diverts focus from development and delays project timelines. Moreover, DDoS attacks can lead to data breaches and theft of user information, compromising privacy and data security.
